              Chatbots answer questions. Agentic tools do the work.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
              Most &quot;AI adoption&quot; stops at asking ChatGPT a question and
              copy-pasting the answer. That&apos;s a search engine with better
              grammar. Agentic coding tools are a fundamentally different
              category: they read your data, write code, build tools, and
              execute multi-step workflows autonomously. Your team gives
              instructions. The AI builds dashboards, generates reports,
              analyzes contracts, and automates pipelines. No coding
              required. No copy-paste. No back-and-forth.

              This is the difference between asking &quot;what were our top
              expenses last quarter?&quot; and saying &quot;build me a
              dashboard that tracks expenses by category, flags anomalies,
              and updates automatically from our accounting data.&quot; One
              is a chatbot. The other is a tool your team built in 10
              minutes.

              Almost nobody has used these tools yet.
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
              Right now, less than 1% of business teams have touched an
              agentic coding tool. Not because they&apos;re not ready. Because
              they don&apos;t know these tools exist. Most people&apos;s
              mental model of AI is still &quot;type a question, get a
              paragraph back.&quot; They have no idea that the same
              technology can build a full financial dashboard from a
              spreadsheet, write and run code, create internal tools, and
              execute complex workflows end to end.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
              That gap is the opportunity. The teams that get trained now
              aren&apos;t just early adopters. They&apos;re operating with
              capabilities their competitors don&apos;t even know are
              possible. By the time everyone else catches on, your team has
              months of compounding experience.
